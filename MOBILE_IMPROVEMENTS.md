# Mobile UX Improvements - SelfMap Test Runner

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Solved
Fixed the poor mobile user experience where users couldn't see navigation buttons without excessive scrolling and had difficulty interacting with tests on mobile devices.

## âœ… Key Improvements Implemented

### 1. **Fixed Navigation (Always Visible)**
- **Problem**: Navigation buttons were below the fold, requiring scrolling to find
- **Solution**: Made navigation fixed to bottom of screen on mobile
- **Benefits**: Users always see "Next" and "Previous" buttons, no scrolling needed

### 2. **Optimized Layout Structure**
- **Mobile-first approach**: Reduced excessive scrolling by optimizing content height
- **Smart spacing**: Better padding and margins for touch interaction
- **Content fit**: Questions now fit better within viewport height

### 3. **Enhanced Question Display**
- **Likert scales**: Converted to vertical layout with better touch targets
- **Multiple choice**: Improved button sizing and spacing for finger taps
- **Better typography**: Adjusted font sizes for mobile readability

### 4. **Visual Feedback & Hints**
- **Navigation hints**: Subtle animation shows users where navigation is
- **Scroll indicators**: Visual cues when content needs scrolling
- **Touch feedback**: Improved button interactions for mobile

### 5. **Responsive Breakpoints**
- **Tablet (â‰¤768px)**: Fixed navigation, optimized layout
- **Mobile (â‰¤480px)**: Compact design, larger touch targets
- **Portrait orientation**: Special optimizations for mobile portrait mode

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### CSS Changes
```css
/* Fixed Navigation for Mobile */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .question-navigation {
    position: fixed !important;
    bottom: 0;
    left: 0;
    right: 0;
    z-index: 1000;
  }
}

/* Optimized Question Cards */
.question-card {
  max-height: calc(100vh - 250px);
  overflow-y: auto;
}

/* Better Touch Targets */
.likert-option {
  min-height: 60px;
  padding: var(--spacing-md);
}
```

### JavaScript Enhancements
